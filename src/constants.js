export const ABOUT_PAGE_TEXT = "Forward43 is a data-driven project with the dream of supporting innovations worldwide by connecting them to decision-makers. \
We aim to create a match-making mechanism for decision-makers to better define their problems and connect them to ‘best-fit’ innovations through using semantic \
match-making, machine learning modules, and purposeful Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\
The project aims to utilize vast data regarding innovations and find a smart framework to solve the world's most pressing issues facing societies, governments, \
organizations or businesses with current existing solutions.\n\n\n\
MasterPeace is a grassroots peace-building organization that believes that the world is '7 billion talents, not issues'. Therefore, we, in MasterPeace, use the \
soft-power of music, art, sports and play to mobilize and inspire young people. We believe that there is more that we have in common than what separates us.\n\n\
Therefore, we organize Dialogues within and between communities and stakeholders. We believe that the lack of perspective triggers polarization, extremism, and \
conflict. Therefore, we create perspective through capacity-building and leadership training for young people. We offer a unique platform to a large community of \
changemakers, social entrepreneurs, volunteers, bloggers, journalists, musicians, entrepreneurs, and active citizens to connect and support each other by taking action.";
